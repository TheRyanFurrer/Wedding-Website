# Wedding-Website
### My personal wedding website

This was a site literally created out of love and was, genuinely, a lot of fun to create! When we got engaged in December 2019 I just knew I had to create our own wedding website rather than using an online service.

I built this site with HTML and SCSS but chose to use Cloudinary as a CDN for the pictures as there are a good amount of them and I want the site as performant as possible. This was my first time using a CDN and thankfully the documentation made it simple enough to get up and running for my use-case of responsive images.
